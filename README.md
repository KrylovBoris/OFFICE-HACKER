# OFFICE-HACKER
Serious videogame for social engineering attack imitation fragment. This publication serves to demonstrate my code and show some Unity coding techniques I used in 2019-2020. As per MIT license you can use any subsystem in your project, however due to the reasons explained below, the project as a whole is not usable in any meaningful capacity.

# NOTICE
To adhere Unity Asset Store EULA and Mixamo Terms of Use we had to remove a lot of graphical assets that we used during the development. The scenes, prefabs, animation controllers and othe Unity Editor files were preserve to showcase the project's architecture, but I sympathize with anyone who dares to try.
