# OFFICE-HACKER
Serious videogame for social engineering attack imitation fragment. This publication serves to demonstrate code and show some Unity coding techniques that were used by me and Daniil Obraztsov in 2019-2020. As per MIT license you can use any subsystem in your project, however due to the reasons explained below, the project as a whole is not usable in any meaningful capacity.

# NOTICE
To adhere Unity Asset Store EULA and Mixamo Terms of Use we had to remove a lot of graphical assets that we used during the development. The scenes, prefabs, animation controllers and othe Unity Editor files were preserve to showcase the project's architecture, but I sympathize with anyone who dares to try. If you want to see how the game looked before the asset purge, you can do this in "images" folder, where I placed files I used during the work on my bachelor's degree.
